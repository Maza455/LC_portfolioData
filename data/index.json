        "First and foremost, I love writing code. Ever since
        writing my first program in Python and manipulating it
        to produce a desired output, I have been obsessed with
        the idea of using software to solve practical problems.
        Software engineering is a never-ending puzzle that I am
        passionately engaged in solving, and I believe in the
        power of programming to transform and improve the
        
        lives of people around the world.",
